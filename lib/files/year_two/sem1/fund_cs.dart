Objective:
    • Distinguish the difference between data and information
    • Define the discipline computer science
    • Define the term computer
    • Identify the several characteristics of computer that made them useful and popular
    • Application of Computers
        1.1 Introduction to Information and Communication Technology
Data versus Information
Data:
    • Simple facts and figures
    • It is raw and unprocessed and therefore meaningless to us.
    • Usually it is the result of experience , observation or experiment
    • Numbers, characters, symbols, images etc., which can be processed by a computer.
    • Data must be interpreted, by a human or machine, to derive meaning
Information:
    • is data that has been processed for use
    • is a human interpretation of knowledge
    • It is processed and selected so that it is useful and applicable
    • has meaning in some context for its receiver
    • When information is entered into and stored in a computer, it is generally referred to as data. After processing (such as formatting and printing), output data can again be perceived as information.
    • When information is packaged or used for understanding or doing something, it is known as knowledge. For example, there are a plenty of items listed on a Menu-Card, in a hotel (data). You don't order everything, you just order the dish you want to eat, (information).


Technology
    • Is a way of solving problems by the application of knowledge from multiple disciplines
Information Technology
    • is "the study, design, development, implementation, support or management of computer based information systems, particularly software applications and computer hardware."
    • IT deals with the use of electronic computers and computer software to convert, store, protect, process, transmit, and securely retrieve information.
    • The combination of computer and communication technologies
    • a general term that describes any technology that helps to produce, manipulate, store, communicate, and/or disseminate information
        1.2 Computer and Computer Science
            1.2.1 What is Computer Science?
Computer Science is a science concerned with information i.e. representation, storage, manipulation or processing and presentation of information. Like any other science, which uses some devices for the practical aspect, computer science uses a special device called COMPUTER.
Computer science has different fields of specialization or sub-disciplines like other sciences. There are seven sub-disciplines of computer science. These are: 
    • Software engineering: Soft ware engineering – It is concerned about the development of a better quality software by applying scientific &basic engineering principles.
    • Computer engineering (Architecture): deals with studying, analyzing and designing of computer hardware (organization and interconnection of computer system components) and its working principle. 
    • Automata theory: Automata Theory Is The study of machines or devices which accept a certain inputs such that the out put or at least the probabilities of output s are determined by the input.

2.1 History of Computers
We have all heard stories of primitive peoples counting their sheep by moving sticks or stones. Our base-ten number system undoubtedly grew from the use of 10 fingers as counting objects.
Together with the development of people, the need to calculate and keep track of information had become popular issue. So they soon develop a simple computing device and had a power of storing small information. However, many thousands of years elapsed before developing mechanical calculator.
Some of the calculating devises are mentioned bellow:

            a) The Abacus: - It is one of the earliest mechanical computational devices. It was in use in the Middle East as early as 2500 BC. The familiar Chinese abacus (dating approximately 1200 AD ) is composed of a frame and a number of wires. The wires correspond to position of digits in decimal number units: tens, hundreds, and so on-and the beads represent digits. Beads above the cross bar represent 5 and that bellow represent 1. 
The abacus shows zero, if all the bead bellow the cross bar are at the lower frame and above are at the upper frame.
Addition of two numbers on the abacus can be performed by representing the first number and the second number without resetting the first. On any wire showing 10 or more, the two beads above the cross bar are moved back, and an extra 1 (the Cary) is added two the wire on the left.

This process can be easily generalized to addition and subtraction of more than two numbers.
            
            b) Pascal’s Calculator: - It is the first true mechanical calculator. In 1642, at the age of 19, the French philosopher and mathematician Blaise Pascal developed a rotating wheel calculator, the predecessor of the latter popular desktop calculator. He built largely to assist his father, who was a tax collector in the town of

Objective:
    • What a computer system is and how it works to process data
        3.1. Introduction

System is a group of components, consisting of subsystems or procedures that work in a coordination fashion to achieve some objective.

A Computer System is composed of components that are classified either as Computer hardware or Computer software.
        3.2. Computer Hardware

Computer architecture is defined as the science of selecting and interconnecting hardware components to create computers that meet functional, performance, and cost goals. It can be described as the logical structure of the computer system.

Computer hardware is the physical part of the computer that can be touched, seen, broken.
What a computer in general does is, that
    • It takes input (in various forms)
    • Process it (according to a given set of instructions) and
    • Produce an output (in required form).
    • Store the information
Based on this the hardware part of a computer system is composed of a number of interacting physical parts. The different hardware parts of a computer which are responsible for these operations are illustrated by the following model.

Objectives:

    • To understand how really data represented, flow, stored and processed inside the computer.
    • To know the different coding systems & unit of data representation.
    • To know different number systems 
    • To know how to convert from one base to another
    • To know how to apply arithmetic operators on binary number system		

We enter data into a computer or review (see) output data from a computer using the letter of alphabet, various special symbols, and the numerals in the decimal number system. But since computer is an electronic device which understands electrical flow (signal) there is no letter, symbol or number inside the computer. Computer works with binary numbers. As a semiconductor is conducting or isn’t conducting; a switch is closed or opened. It is not surprising, therefore, that almost all of the present day computers are based on binary system of representation that uses only two symbols – 1 and 0. 
Any information stored in the computer system is first converted into binary number and then stored in the computer memory or hard disk in the form of 1s and 0s. 
For example, to convert 7 into binary number, we divide it by 2.

    • To know the different layers of a computer system
    • To know the basic building blocks of computer and how they   work

1.1 Hierarchical structuring of a computer system Architecture

Actually a computer system is composed of many layers of software and hardware.  But for simplicity we see the computer in Abstract way.  This avoids details and makes the user to concern about the outer layer that is easy for the user to communicate with the computer. 
Generally modern computers consist of multi-layers or levels.  The following figure shows the different levels.

Basics of Data Communication
 Data communication: is the process of sharing ideas, information and messages with others in a particular time and place.
    • It is exchange of data between two or more parties.
    • It includes :
        ◦ Writing and talking
        ◦ Nonverbal communication (such as facial expressions, body language or gestures)
        ◦ Visual communication (the use of images of pictures such as painting, photography, video or film)
        ◦ Electronic Communication 
        ◦ Such as telephone calls, electronic mail, cable television, satellite broadcasts.

	Data Transmission
The need of information has increased from time to time.  This leads to the need of sharing of information among different agents (individual), which may be at different places or locations. Data communication is the exchange of information between two agents.  For exchange of information, the information should be transmitted from one point to another through a transmission media called Channel.  The following figure shows the different components of data communication.

Security: The prevention and protection of computer assets from unauthorized access,
use, alteration, degradation, destruction, and other threats.
•
•
Computer systems should have a set of protection policies to restrict and control
the system resources
Considering:
– Unauthorized access
– Malicious modification or destruction
– Accidental introduction of inconsistency
Security Goals
• Data Confidentiality
– Is concerned with having secret data remain secret
• Data Integrity
– Unauthorized users should not be able to modify any data without the
owners permission
– Includes removing data and adding false data
•
System Availability
– Means nobody can disturb the system to make it unusable
Computer security threats
A computer security threat is any person, act, or object that poses a danger to
computer security
Computer world is full of threats!
• Denial of Service
– Blocking access from legitimate users
– Overload the targeted computer preventing it from doing any useful work
• Hacking:
– Any attempt to gain unauthorized access to your system
• Trap door
– Created by code inserted into system by a system programmer to bypass
some normal checks
– Specific user identifier or password that circumvents normal security
procedures
